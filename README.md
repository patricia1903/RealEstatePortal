# RealEstatePortal


### Project Description

An application that allows landlords(not real estate agencies) to post owning properties for sale.
Each post will have pictures, a short description, price, and contact info. Besides that,
each property post will have a comment section where customers will be allowed to ask further questions or
those whom seen live the property to write their own impressions.
Every property can be rated(1-10). A chart will be displayed for each property displaying a relationship between the rating and users.
The exact address of the property will be provided in order to be correctly localized on Google Maps.
To be able to use the application, a user must be logged in. To be able to post a property the user must be logged in as a landlord. Users logged in as tenants cannot post properties.
